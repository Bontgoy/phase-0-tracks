# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control is a way to manage our files so that our finished work is always optimized.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  Branching is to separate your master version from code that you are working.  You want to put all of your work on feature branches and push it up for code review before adding to master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  A commit is a snapshop of your workflow at a current stage.  A good message tells us what we did during this part of the feature.

  A merge conflict is when you edit a file ona conflicting branch and try to merge when the changes in time line do not match.
